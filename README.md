# Pulsar Candidate Classification
Machine learning classification of pulsar candidates from UCI Machine Learning Repository's HTRU2 data.

### Data
  - Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2
  - Size: 17898 rows Ã— 9 columns
  - Constraints: This data did not include the frequency range in which each signal was captured, nor time of capture. Had this been included, I would have sought to investigate survey efficiency over time.

### Stack
  - python
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - sklearn model_selection
  - sklearn preprocessing
  - imblearn
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
  
### Models
  - Logisitic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Linear SVC
  - Random Forest
  - KNN
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - Stochastic Gradient Decent
  - Decision Tree

### Deliverables
  - [ ] Jupyter notebook pushed to Github
  - [ ] EDA notebook
  - [ ] README.md file in the GitHub repository that describes the nature and contents of the repository
  - [ ] "Executive Summary" slide deck/presentation
  - [ ] notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code
  - [ ] notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results
